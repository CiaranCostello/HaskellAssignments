CS3016 Labs

This repo contains the Haskell Labs for CS3016 in academic year 2015-16.

Each lab will appear earlier in the week of the relevant lab session in ICTLAB1
(usually Tue morning for Thu afternoon lab).

In general the sources for Lab(n+1) will contains solutions to Lab(n), 
hence the deadline for labs being first thing on a Tue morning.
